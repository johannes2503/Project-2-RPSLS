# User Experience (UX)


## Wireframes

The wireframes for Restaurant were produced in [Figma](https://figma.com). There are frames for a full width display. The final site varies slightly from the wireframes due to developments that occured during the creation process.

## Design Choices

 * ### Typography
      The fonts chosen were 'Montserrat' for all fonts in the game. They fall back to sans-serif respectively. 

 * ### Colour Scheme
      The colors are very bright and fun. They were chosen to brighten up the game and give some lightness to it.

# Testing

## Code Validation
The RPSLS game site has be throughly tested. All the code has been run through the [W3C html Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and [JSHint javascript validator](https://jshint.com/). Errors were found. After a fix and retest, no errors were returned. 

The HTML validator results for each page are below:

* Home page

![W3C Validator test result](./assets/images/readme-images/html-check.png)

* Main game page

The CSS validator results are below:

![CSS Validator test result](./assets/images/readme-images/CSS%20check.png)

## Responsiveness Test

* The responsive design tests were carried out manually with [Google Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) and [Responsive Design Checker](https://www.responsivedesignchecker.com/).

|        | Moto G4 | Galaxy S5 | iPhone 5 | iPad | iPad Pro | Display <1200px | Display >1200px |
|--------|---------|-----------|----------|------|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Render | pass    | pass      | pass     | pass | pass     | pass            | pass            |
| Images | pass    | pass      | pass     | pass | pass     | pass            | pass            |
| Links  | pass    | pass      | pass     | pass | pass     | pass            | pass            |

Note: On wide display types the contents of the site are restricted in width to 2000px. This helps the UX by not spreading the content too wide on the extra wide screens.

## Browser Compatibility

RPSLS game was tested on the following browsers with no visible issues for the user. 
Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari and Mozilla Firefox. Appearance, functionality and responsiveness were consistent throughout for a range of device sizes and browsers.

## Known Bugs
* ### Resolved

    * During validation two bugs became known during the validation stage, a brief description is below:

    * CSS - 
    Wrong attribute for one of the text elements. Fixed.


* ### Unresolved
    * JavaScript warnings in the JShint validator.
